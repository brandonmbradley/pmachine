1) Load all files into Eustis
	- We have three header files, 2 c files, and a main.c (driver) file. We have to use the scp command in the terminal on the virtual machine to load the files onto Eustis. We would have to put all the files along with the input file into the same directory so that way it's easier to run the program. 

2) Compiling on Eustis
	- First find the location os where you copied the files to.
	- Next compile your main source code, ours is called main.c
	
	*What to put into the terminal*
	gcc main.c -o prog3
	
3) Running on Eustis
	- Once you put your newly executable file (courtesy of the gcc command) and the input file into the same directory you can use the ./ command to actually run the program.
	
	./prog3 <inputfile>
